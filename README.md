#About Me
Hi! My name is Ashley Phillips and this is my second year here at Wake Tech. I recently switched into the IT program and hope to graduate with my degree in cloud infrastructure. 
##My Interests
I am always busy but in my free time I love trying new restaurants with my friends and my boyfriend, listening and dancing to all kinds of music, and watching movies. I love horror movies. Some of my favorites are _The Substance_, _Scream_, and Ti West's _Pearl_. I also really enjoy hanging out with my family and our cat Stanley.
